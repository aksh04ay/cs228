(a) [Naive Bayes] 10-fold cross validation total test accuracy 0.9181 on 232 examples
     Test error = 0.0819


(b) [TANB] 10-fold cross validation total test accuracy 0.9526 on 232 examples
     Test error = 0.0474

(c) P(C=1|A_observed) = 0.9899
     P(A=12|A_observed) = 0.1022


(d) Naive Bayes (Test accuracy on a smaller subset)
     10-fold cross validation total test accuracy 0.9009 on 232 examples
     Test error = 0.0991

     TANB Classifier (Test accuracy on a smaller subset)
     10-fold cross validation total test accuracy 0.8922 on 232 examples
     Test error = 0.1078

The test error for TANB is higher than that for Naive Bayes.
This is happening because TANB probably overfits the training
data due to greater freedom in setting conditional probabilities.
